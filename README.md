# MetaMotion-Gait-Tracking

In this project, there is a code to colect the data from a MetaMotionRL, witch uses a BMI160 acelerometer and a BMI160 gyroscope too.
In the end of the code we use the Fusion AHRS algorithm to do the gait  tracking.

To use this code you need to install mbientlab to use the metamotions data colect functions and install fusion library
